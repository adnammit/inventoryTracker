INTRODUCTION:

This simple inventory tracking program was my first attempt at 
reading in from and writing out to external files in C++, allowing
me to start working with larger amounts of data. 

This was also one of my first forays into using nodes and linear
linked lists, in which I started to get comfortable with pointers
and dynamically allocated memory.

RUNNING IT:

Once the files have been downloaded, from the command line simply type 
"make" and then "./play".

To recompile after making changes, type "make" again.
To delete all executables, type "make clean".

That's it!
Hope you enjoy my silly program.
